        <h1>Review - AFCM 25th Anniversary Concert</h1>
        <p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied
            music lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity
            for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anniversary with it's first ever outdoor public performance.</p>
        <p>The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert opneded with the ccaremonial and pompous Brass composition
            by Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William
            Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the performace by Camerata of St Johns with their virtuosic
            classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance with
            her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.

        <p>1RAR Big Band playd to the high standard Townsville ausiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet
            to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Baker's powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely
            was heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel.
        </p>
        <p> The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful
            to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasnt afternoon can only be rated as
            a huge success and may prove to be the first of amny performances in years to come.
