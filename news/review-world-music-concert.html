        <h1>Review - World Music Concert</h1>
        <p>The World Music Concert was a breath of fresh air to Townsville music lovers who had just about reached classical
            music saturation following AFCM.</p>
        <p>Andrew Ryder poured his expertise and enthusiasm into this opportunity provided through Townsville City Council sponsorship.
            Andrew developed the concept for the concert; sourced the music which involved him personally arranging some
            of the music; liaising with the professional performers; and rehearsing and conducting the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The performance delighted more than one sense through the visual backdrop showing scenery pertinent to the music
            and the amazing musical sound evoking toe tapping, clapping, singing and sheer enjoyment.</p>
        <p>The world tour began with David Hudson on didgeridoo, guitar and vocals synchronizing with the visual backdrop to
            grab the audiences' attention, performing the popular John Williamson ballad Raining on the Rock. The tour continued
            through Korea and Cuba courtesy of a quality Barrier Reef Orchestral performance. Next, virtuosic Domenico Taraborrelli
            on piano accordion and vocalist Adam Lopez, supported by the Orchestra, engaged the audience with Latin American
            pieces. Unfortunately the balance was a little off, with the soloists being much louder.</p>
        <p>The second half began with the Barrier Reef Orchestra creating an American theme through Aaron Copland before heading
            off to Europe with the Orchestra supporting Domenico once again in Italy, John Ferguson on bagpipes with vocalist
            Cynthia Clark in Scotland and Adam Lopez in Spain.</p>
        <img src="../assets/images/news/HelenLandWorldMusic.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>The tour aptly returned to Australia with all the soloists returning to the stage to present a rousing and emotive
            performance of I am Australian.</p>
        <p>This very enjoyable performance once again demonstrated the talented people choosing to live in Townsville and able
            to produce such a high class production, equal to anywhere. This was reinforced by the willingness of quality
            professional musicians to come to Townsville and perform with the Barrier Reef Orchestra. I feel certain if more
            was known about the concert the Civic Theatre would easily have been at capacity.</p>
