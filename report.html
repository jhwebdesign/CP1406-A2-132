        <h3>Jason Hill</h3>
        <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> ...</p>
        <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> ...</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> ...</p>

        <h3>Emma Gulliver</h3>
        <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The pluses for the project is that we worked well as a group, divided parts up evenly and managed to make the website look good</p>
        <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> The minuses of the project are that not all of us knew how to do all the coding, taking the stuff that is not needed off the website and not being able to meet up enough as a group because of busy schedules</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> The interesting parts of the project was when i learnt how to add a button that linked to a file and how to do a form that wasn't just text entries</p>

        <h3>Tarryn Tourle</h3>
        <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Friendly group and well communicated. Jason was a great group leader who is very skilled in coding and the process of creating websites, which was very helpful to me as I was very confused with these skills. The assignment
            was delegated well and fairly and everyone made an effort to be a part of the group.</p>
        <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Self-reflection: I didnâ€™t have the knowledge and understanding to construct the codes or forums, from pracs and lectures. More hands on practices in the workshops should be conducted. Instead of just giving the pracs
            and uploading them on jcu learn the teacher should walk everyone through an example. I feel like those skills could have benefited me alot in this assignment.</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> I learnt a lot within the assignment; coding, links and constructing processes. It was very helpful to work in a group and have the other student help and teach practical skills.</p>

        <h3>Kathleen Dinwall</h3>
        <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The positive things about this assignment were that being in a group you could discuss everything with your members. If you were having trouble you could easily ask for help. </p>
        <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> A negative thing was trying to organise when we could meet up to discuss designs or people of replying to messages. This was my first group assignment and I learnt that communication is key. </p>
